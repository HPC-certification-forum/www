Certificates bundle skill usefully together and structure examinations.

We are currently working on releasing the first certificate for the cluster operating system subtree [use/1/1](https://www.hpc-certification.org/wiki/skill-tree/use/1/b).
If you are interested in the progress subscribe to our [mailing list](http://localhost:4000/listinfo/).

## Examinations

The online examinations to gain the HPC certificates will be multiple-choice tests.
For each competence and level, a pool of questions will be developed, of which a subset is selected for each individual examination. Once the test is completed, the system will automatically assess the results and create a PDF with the certificate. At the beginning, we will manually approve the test results.

### Exam questions

Per (leaf) skill we aim for having a pool of at least 5 (multiple selections) questions per learning objective, each with 10 potential answer choices of which 5 should be correct and 5 should be wrong.

## Abstract
The goal of the HPC Certification Forum is to clearly categorize, define, and examine competencies expected from proficient HPC practitioners. The HPC Certification Forum (HPCCF) has the role of the central authority to curate and maintain the certification program. The program consists of three parts: competencies defined in a modular and easily expandable skill tree, the examination process to verify that practitioners possess those skills, and finally the certification demonstrating their knowledge. Although the forum is not involved in the development of any training materials or tools, it supports the ecosystem around the competencies.
The ultimate goal of the forum is to offer a free globally acknowledged certification program that would make the HPC education and training more transparent and quantifiable for training providers, and easier to navigate for practitioners.

The goal of the organized workshops is to discuss the opportunities for establishing a globally acknowledged HPC certification process.
To allow attendees to attend regardless of their timezone, we organize one workshop suitable for EU/US attendees and one for EU/Eastern attendees.
While the HPC Certification Forum has made progress over the last two years, we still require the input and the contributions from the wider HPC community to ensure that this will become a community-endorsed effort.
To make sure this is an independent community-wide effort, we invite anyone interested in HPC teaching and training to participate in the discussion.

**The workshop(s) will be recorded and YouTube videos will be provided on this page.**

## Agenda (US/EU Workshop)

Each of the talks is followed by a short Q&A.

### Introduction to the HPC Certification Forum (20 minutes)
  * **About the HPC Certification Forum** -- *[Julian Kunkel (University of Reading)](https://hps.vi4io.org/about/people/julian_kunkel)* <br/> <!-- [Slides](/assets/talks/isc19-hpccf.pdf) -->
  Abstract: *This talk introduces the forum and gives an overview of its role and performed activities, the status and strategies for long-term sustainability.*

### Invited Speakers (10 minutes each)
  * **SIG HPC Education** -- *[Julie Mullen (MIT)](https://www.ll.mit.edu/biographies/julie-mullen)*
  * **Best Practices for Performance Engineering Training** -- *[Bernd Mohr (Forschungszentrum Jülich)](https://www.fz-juelich.de/SharedDocs/Personen/IAS/JSC/EN/staff/mohr_b.html)* <br/> *My team and I perform about 10-15 performance engineering training and tutorial events on average every year for the past 20 years. As a member of the Virtual Institute High Productivity Supercomputing (vi-hps.org) we also organize and undertake so-called 3-5 day Tuning Workshops, where participants learn how to use HPC performance tools and then apply these tools to their own application codes under supervision of experts.*
  * **The HPC Academy** -- *[Michael Resch (HLRS Stuttgart)](https://www.hlrs.de/about-us/organization/people/person/resch/)*

### Examination and certification of HPCCF (20 minutes)
  * **Certification strategy and contributions** -- *Christian Meesters (Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz)* <br/>
  Abstract: *This talk presents the draft for the certification process, the examinations, the design of the question pool, and how contributions can be made to the question pool.*

### Discussion
  * Recognition of certificates
  * Obtaining a critical mass of questions

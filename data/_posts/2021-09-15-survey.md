We created a survey at [Google Forms](https://forms.gle/ujtXH5urdP5CwKsR7) to learn more about your satisfaction with HPC systems and your training experience.
The aim of the survey is to identify how the training community can progress most effectively.
All HPC practitioners are invited which includes end users, administrators, and generally anyone developing or using HPC systems.
Please contribute to our efforts by filling the form until August 15th!
To particpate, please fill the [Google Form](https://forms.gle/ujtXH5urdP5CwKsR7).

We will share the statistics of each individual question as CSV-files and create a report.

We thank our contributors from HPC CF and the NHR centers for their contributions.

## Meetings

Join our [Slack Channel](https://join.slack.com/t/hpc-certification/shared_invite/enQtMzUwNzU3NzM2MTkzLTAzZWM3NDg0N2I2ZmQwOWI5ZGUwNjNlNDgzM2RmOTM3ZWRjNjIxYTc5NzUxYTJhNmRlNmM5YmE1NDY3YzkzYzA).

We organize meet on a monthly basis to discuss the status.
The meetings are open for anyone that is interested to participate.
The PC will post invites via the [members mailinglist](/mailman/listinfo/hpccf-members).

At the moment, we explore using Slack for the meetings to allow everybody to read the progress of the discussion and to comment upon any action item.

### Slack meeting process

The meetings in Slack follow this procedure:

  - The PC will post the tentative agenda before the meeting.
    - You may respond to this with proposals for further agenda items by starting a thread as a response.  
  - Attendees should **like the agenda (thumbs up)** such that others can later see s/he attended.
  - We will then walk through the agenda but may **process several topics at the same time**.
    - The PC will post the next item providing a further description and thoughts.
    - Attendees are expected to comment on this item in a follow up message.
    - When an item is sufficiently settled, e.g. the response rate is low, the PC will move to the next item -- that does not necessarily mean we have completed the discussion but we increase parallelism!
  - Attendees can comment **anytime** upon **any agenda item** starting a thread underneath it.
  - Voting is done using thumbs up or thumbs down underneath the respective item that is to debate

We are currently working on the classification of the HPC competences and have initially identified four major topics for the HPC Certification Program as “HPC Knowledge”, “Use of the HPC Environment”, “Performance Engineering”, and “Software Engineering”.
We are in the process to extend these topics with two sub-trees about "Administration" and "Big Data Analytics".

The **top levels** of the current skill tree are shown here (the tree can be expanded):

![Skill tree](/assets/img/skill-tree.jpg "Skill tree"){:style="width:100%;"}

The goal is that the granularity of **leaf-level nodes** covers about 1.5h to 4h of material about a topic such that they could be delivered as part of a workshop or lecture.

A wiki for the skills (editable for members) is [available here](https://www.hpc-certification.org/wiki/).

An interactive map of the skill tree is [available here](/skills/map).

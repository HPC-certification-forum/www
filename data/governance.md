#### Mandate and Election

The steering board elected for one year (period of activity) where a period ends in June with a general assembly during ISC HPC.
The steering board attempts to submit a Bird-of-a-Feather session to ISC that serves as general assembly for the members.
In case the BoF was not accepted, we will organize an alternative meeting during ISC HPC.
The organization of the general assembly falls into the responsibility of the general chair and steering board but should involve the new steering board members.
A time slot should be reserved for the new steering board to present an updated roadmap.

Voting is done publicly on a Slack channel "election" in the HPC Certification forum.
Everyone can nominate someone at the channel or self-nominate themself by posting a message with the name of the nominee, the position, and a brief description.
The brief description should state why the nominee is qualified/seeks to become chair member for the given position.

At the end of the nomination phase, the program chair will compose a list of candidates for each position.
HPCCF members can then vote using thumbs up on the candidate(s) they like.
The members are encouraged to vote based on past contributions made by a nominee and the potential they see by appointing the chair in the initiative.

Members can send any concern regarding a nominee privately to the board (either by Slack or by Email).
By providing good reasons that a candidate is not suitable, the steering board can exclude a candidate from the nominee list.
Before doing so, the steering board will contact the nominee and assess the situation.

**Timeline:**
  * Nomination until April 30st
  * Announcement of candidates by Program Chair: first week of May
  * Voting takes place until May 31st

If a board members resigns/steps down during an election period having less than 6 month in the current period, the current steering board can elect a potential candidate to fulfill the role for the rest of the period.
If more than 6 month are remaining, an election for this position is announced.

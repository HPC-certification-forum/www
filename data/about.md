## Motivation

The HPC community has always considered the training of new and existing HPC practitioners to be of high importance to its growth. The significance of training will increase even further in the era of Exascale when HPC encompasses even more scientific disciplines. This diversification of HPC practitioners challenges the traditional training approaches, which are not able to satisfy the specific needs of users, often coming from non-traditionally HPC disciplines and only interested in learning a particular set of skills. HPC centres are struggling to identify and overcome the gaps in users’ knowledge. How should we support prospective and existing users who are not aware of their own knowledge gaps?  

The diversification of HPC practitioners challenges the traditional training approaches, which are not able to satisfy the specific needs of users, often coming from non-traditionally HPC disciplines and only interested in learning a particular set of skills.
HPC practitioners are expected to have various HPC skills, however, those “skills” have not been well-defined until now. The ability to speak a common language -- among HPC educators and users  -- is critical.

The HPCCF strives to identify this set of [competences](/cs/) for HPC users.
It is our aim to thereby facilitate course offers across HPC sites and to provide a certification procedure for HPC practitioners.
Ultimately, we aim for the certificates to be recognized and respected by the HPC community and industry.

## Benefits

An international HPC Certification program benefits the various stakeholders such as practitioners, data centers, and training providers.

  * HPC practitioners
    *  Increase motivation to participate as the certificates are recognized in a CV
    *  Validate knowledge via tests
    *  Browse relevant competences
    *  Identify recommended and required skills related to certain tasks
    *  Understand and compare teaching offers across sites

 * Data centers
   * Tailor skill-tree specifically to users
   * Correlate lack of skills with efficient use

 * Training provider
    * Increase sharing of teaching materials
    * Simplifies documentation of taught skills
    * Identify missing teaching activities

The program brings multiple benefits to everyone involved in HPC
teaching and training.
Making clear what skills are required or recommended for a competent HPC user would be
helpful to both the HPC service providers and practitioners.
Training providers could bundle together skills that are most beneficial for specific user roles and scientific domains, which would allow practitioners to browse through skills to quickly identify and learn the skills required to perform their tasks.
The variety of training offered within our community makes finding the right resources more complicated than it should be – the certification program will provide useful information where the desired skills could be learned.

The examination confirming that a certain set of competencies has been acquired makes the learning process more complete and meaningful. By participating in the program, HPC training providers can increase the visibility of their teaching opportunities and share their resources more effectively.
The mapping of the skills defined by the program onto the existing training materials should also help to identify any potential gaps and improve the integrity of offered training.
Finally, the certificates recognised by the whole
HPC community simplify inter-comparison of independently offered courses and provide additional incentive for participation.
Overall, the flexibility of the program allows to construct more personalised and just-in-time pathways to learning about HPC.

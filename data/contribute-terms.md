We thank you for the prospect contribution to the examination questions for the <b>HPC Certification Forum (HPCCF)</b>.

In order to accept your contribution(s), we must ask your consent to the following license terms.

## Core points of the License Terms and Rationale

* Contributions are exclusive to the HPCCF.
  If you submit something, you loose rights of sharing the contributions with third parties. The reason for this is that we do not want databases of correct answers to be exchanged on the Internet.

* As an exception to the last point, you retain the right to use the contributed material in non-obvious ways.
  So, if you contribute a question, you may use a variant of the same question in tests you devise, as long as the connection of the question to the HPCCF is unclear.
  Remember, we do not want databases of correct answers to be built by anyone else but us, and as long as you make it impossible for your contribution to end up in such a database, that's fine with us.

* Your name and your email address will be stored for documentation of your contribution and consent to the rules.
